# TI Vault: Parametric tool to design Topological Interlocking Vaults

TI Vault is a set of scripts developed by Elena Shilova, Taole Chen and Philip Singer to create 3-dimensional topological Interlocking geometries out of custom two-dimensional patterns. The tool works with Flat and 3-dimensional vaults and allows to create interlocking blocks with planar or rules interfaces. The resulting interlocking systems can be utilized as architectural enclosures or floor slabs.
The TI Vault toolkit is a part of ongoing research by Elena Shilova and Taole Chen.
The research been supported through collaborations with Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in France and The Bartlett School of Architecture, UK.

More details on the tool can be found here in the resent paper: 

[Bridging The Gap Between Academia and Practice A case study for collaborative digital design to fabrication workflow for interlocking kit-of-parts; eCAADe 2023](https://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/ecaade2023_157.pdf)

The Toolkit has been deployed at the following: 
* Advances in Architectural Geometry 2018, Workshop 15: Interlocking-based Robotic Fabrication of Segmented Shells: Formwork-free and mortar-free assembly
* Advances in Architectural Geometry 2020, Workshop 3: ReCycled. Sustainable strategies for robotic fabrication of segmented shells
